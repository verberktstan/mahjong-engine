A Clojure library implementing a simple Mahjong game-engine.

> (def game (new-game))

; Some GETTERS...
; Return the players of the game
((game :players))

; Return the hand of the current player
((game :hand))

; Return the wall of Mahjong-tiles
((game :wall))

; Return a frequency-map of the discarded-tiles
((game :discard-pile))

; Some SETTERS...
; Update the game -> Draw 14 tiles to the hand of the current player
((game :draw-tiles) 14)

; Update the game -> Discard a tile (requires user input!)
((game :discard-tile) (first ((game :hand))))

; Update the game -> Rotate the players (next player's turn)
((game :rotate-players))

; Let's say current player has already 13 tiles in is hand
((game :draw-tiles) 13)

; Usually you'd draw a tile at the beginning of a turn
